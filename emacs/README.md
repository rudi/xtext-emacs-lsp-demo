# Creating an Emacs mode

Documentation on how to write an Emacs major mode to support a new language
can be found in the Emacs Lisp manual, Section 23.2 (Major Modes).  To read
the Emacs Lisp manual inside Emacs, press `C-h i m elisp RET`.

An good list of resources related to development on Emacs is the The Emacs
Package Developerâ€™s Handbook at
https://github.com/alphapapa/emacs-package-dev-handbook.
