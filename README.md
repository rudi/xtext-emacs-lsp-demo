# Running an Xtext-generated language server in Emacs

This repository contains sample code showing how to run a language server generated by [Xtext](http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/) from within Emacs via [emacs-lsp](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode).

The “entities” language used for this example is described in the book
[Implementing Domain-Specific Languages with Xtext and Xtend - Second
Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/product/implementing-domain-specific-languages-with-xtext-and-xtend-second-edition/9781786464965)
by [Lorenzo Bettini](http://www.lorenzobettini.it).

To run the examples, first build the language server with the command 

   `cd xtext-lsp-server ; ./gradlew assemble`
   
## Emacs

1. Install `lsp-mode` as described on the project page at https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode

2. Load `emacs/entities-mode.el` into Emacs

3. Check the path in `entities-ls-jar`; adapt if necessary

4. Open `sample.entities` in Emacs

5. Start the language server with `M-x eglot` (or `M-x lsp` if you use lsp-mode)

6. Position the cursor on `Hello25`; check that cross-highlighting and `M-.` (aka `M-x xref-find-definitions`) work
