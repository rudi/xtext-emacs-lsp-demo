# Running an Xtext-generated language server in Emacs

This repository contains sample code showing how to run a language server generated by [Xtext](http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/) from within Emacs via [emacs-lsp](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode).

To run the example, do the following:

1. Build the language server

   `./gradlew assemble`
   
2. Load `entities-mode.el` into Emacs

3. Check the path in `entities-ls-jar`; adapt if necessary

4. Open `sample.entities` in Emacs

5. Start the language server with `M-x lsp`

6. Position the cursor on `Hello25`; check that cross-highlighting and `M-.` (aka `M-x xref-find-definitions`) work
